# BPMN
A Business Process Model for a customer order fulfillment system designed on Lucid chart. The system uses numerous events and actions starting from receiving an order from the customer to informing the seller and the warehouse associate about the requested product. 

Start: The process begins when a customer places an order. This could be through various channels like a website, phone call, or in-person.

Order Capture: The system captures the order details, including the products or services requested, quantity, shipping address, payment information, and any special instructions.

Order Validation: The order is validated to ensure that all necessary information is complete and accurate. This step may involve checking the availability of products in the inventory and verifying the customer's payment details.

Inventory Check: The system checks the inventory to ensure that the ordered products are available. If products are not in stock, a backorder or alternative fulfillment process may be initiated.

Order Processing: Once the order is validated and the inventory is confirmed, the order moves to the processing stage. This involves preparing the products for shipment or preparing the services for delivery.

Shipping and Delivery: In the case of physical products, the order is packaged and shipped to the customer's specified address. For services, the necessary arrangements are made to provide the service to the customer.

Order Tracking: Throughout the fulfillment process, customers may be provided with order tracking information to monitor the status and location of their order.

Delivery Confirmation: Once the order is delivered or the service is provided, the system may generate a delivery confirmation notification to the customer.

Order Completion: The process concludes with the successful fulfillment of the customer's order.
